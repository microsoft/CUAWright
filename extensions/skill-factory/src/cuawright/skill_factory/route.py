"""Route a task: judge, then act — run a matching skill directly, or hand it to the agent.

One entry, symmetric. `route` decides (search the library, pick a skill, judge run-vs-adapt, fill
params) and then carries the decision out:

  run    the skill is executable, covers the task, and every slot fills -> run it. If it produces
         a well-shaped answer, that is the answer and no agent starts. If it fails (crash, timeout,
         empty, wrong shape) it falls back to the agent, exactly as an adapt would.
  adapt  reuse the skill but not as-is -> hand the task to the agent with the skill as a prior.
  skip   nothing useful -> hand the task to the agent from scratch.

Judgement, execution, and fallback all live here; the two executors are injected so this file
holds only the policy, not their mechanics: `run_skill_fn` runs a skill, `agent_fn(task, hint)`
launches the agent. When `agent_fn` is None (inspection / the CLI) the agent branch returns the
resolved instruction instead of launching — so you can see the decision without acting on it.
