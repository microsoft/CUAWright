"""Prompt helper: prepend a resolved SKILL-LIBRARY hint to a task prompt so the agent reuses it.

The library lookup is done HERE, out of the agent's step loop, not by the agent. Earlier this
hint injected a bash COMMAND for the agent to run; the agent then spent its first few steps
querying the library, reading the source, and recording a decision before it ever touched the
browser — and paid all of that even when the verdict was "skip". Every input to that lookup (the
task text, the library path) is known before the agent starts, so it is resolved up front and the
RESULT is injected instead:

  skip / error  -> nothing is prepended: no tokens, no wasted steps.
  use / adapt   -> the chosen skill, its source path, and grade-honest reuse guidance are prepended,
                   so the agent's first real step is work, not a lookup.

Kept at the prompt level (not system_template) because webwright merges system_template by
replacement; a task-prompt hint is non-invasive and leaves default behavior unchanged when unused.
