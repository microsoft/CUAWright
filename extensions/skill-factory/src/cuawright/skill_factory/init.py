"""python -m cuawright.skill_factory init "<one-line need>" — draft a skill spec to review.

One LLM call turns a natural-language need into a skill.yaml DRAFT: a task template with
{parameter} holes, a *guessed* start_url, and a few PROPOSED instances — real, varied values to
fill the template. The proposals are a starting point, not ground truth: they are marked as
guesses, and a wrong one would quietly train the skill on the wrong answer, so REVIEW them
(replace, add, or delete rows) before running `build skill.yaml`. `--rows` sets how many
instances to propose. If the task is account-scoped (values private to your login), the model is
told to leave the rows blank rather than invent plausible-looking wrong ones.

    "The user almost always describes ONE CONCRETE INSTANCE of a task they will repeat with "

    "name, a count — becomes a {hole}. Do not echo their example values back; the task must "
    "contain holes, not their specifics.\n"

    "task MUST appear in params and vice-versa. Ask for the answer in a stable, unambiguous form. "
