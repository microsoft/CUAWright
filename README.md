# CUAWright

> **Webwright is now CUAWright.** Alongside browser automation, you can now run
> desktop tasks in an Ubuntu VM. Use `cuawright web` for browser tasks and
> `cuawright desktop` for desktop tasks. Existing `webwright` commands and Python
> imports still work.

CUAWright gives coding models a terminal to automate browsers and desktop applications.
Use Webwright to browse the web and build reusable Playwright scripts, or run your
own desktop task and reproduce OSWorld-V2 benchmarks in an Ubuntu VM.

Start with the [browser quick start](#-browser-quick-start) or
[desktop quick start](#desktop-quick-start).

Already got your favorite agents, and wonder how to make Claude Code, Codex, Hermes more capable in browser tasks? Consider adding [CUAWright browser plugin/skill](#-use-as-a-plugin)!

## 📰 News

- **2026-10-03** — **Webwright → CUAWright:** renamed the project to bring browser and desktop agents together. The Webwright browser runtime is now `cuawright.webwright`, and OSWorld desktop support lives at `cuawright.desktop`. Existing `webwright` commands and imports remain compatible. See [desktop setup](docs/desktop.md).
- **2026-09-01** — Persistent step-by-step browsing and native `run_command` tool calls improve performance to **88.1% on Online-Mind2Web** and **77.5% on Odysseys**.
- **2026-07-21** — Skill Factory: every solve leaves a script behind, distilled into reusable, verified, parameterized code skills that rerun standalone with no model (~40 s, zero tokens). On WebArena, reuse lifts held-out accuracy 55% → 70% (+15 pp). See the optional [Skill Factory](#-skill-factory-turn-solved-tasks-into-runnable-code-skills).
- **2026-05-11** — Support Task2UI mode: Webwright completes the task and renders task results into an HTML-based web app you can easily view and reuse.  
- **2026-05-06** — Codex and Claude Code plugin manifests added; install via `/plugin install cuawright@cuawright`. Hermes Agent integration shipped; the same `skills/cuawright-web/` folder now loads across Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes.
- **2026-05-04** — Initial public release: ~1.5k LoC, OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter backends, Playwright environment.

<summary><strong>💡 Motivation: Beyond Step-by-Step Web Interaction in a Stateful Browser</strong></summary>

Most web agents today treat the browser session itself as the workspace: at each step the model receives the current page state and predicts a single next operation — a click, a type, a DOM selector, or a short tool call. Whatever the format, the agent is locked into predicting one web action at a time inside a predefined interaction loop. That harness was useful when LLMs were weaker. As models get stronger at writing and debugging code, the same harness becomes a bottleneck.

Webwright takes a different stance: **separate the agent from the browser**, and treat the browser as something the agent can launch, inspect, and discard while developing a program. The persistent artifact is not the browser session — it's the **code and logs in the local workspace**.

- 🧱 **Robust, reusable interaction with web environments** — instead of fragile pixel-level actions, a coding agent with a terminal queries elements, waits for conditions, and handles dynamic behaviors like lazy loading or re-rendering. The resulting scripts can be rerun, adapted, and shared across tasks rather than rediscovered from scratch.
- ⚡ **Efficient composition of complex workflows** — multi-step interactions like selecting a date or filling a form become a compact program. Loops, functions, and abstractions let the agent generalize across similar tasks (e.g. different dates) without re-predicting the same low-level sequences. Fewer interaction rounds, faster execution, less error accumulation on long horizons.
- 🧪 **Workspace-as-state, not browser-as-state** — the agent can write exploratory scripts, spawn fresh browser sessions, and decide for itself when to capture screenshots and inspect failures, much like a human engineer iterating on an RPA script.
- 🪄 **Surprisingly effective despite being minimal** — this stripped-down setup turns out to handle complex and especially long-horizon web tasks well (see [Performance](#-performance)).

<details>
<summary><strong>🌟 Why Webwright</strong></summary>

Most web agent frameworks bury the actual agent loop under layers of abstractions. Webwright takes the opposite stance:

- 🪶 **Readable core** — browser agent loop, environments, models, and CLI are separate modules under `src/cuawright/webwright/`.
- 🧩 **Pluggable model backends** — OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter, each ~150–200 lines.
- 🔍 **Zero hidden frameworks** — just `httpx`, `pydantic`, `playwright`, and `typer`.
- 🔁 **Flat prompt → observe → execute script loop** — readable end-to-end, easy to debug, easy to fork.
- 🧪 **Run-artifact first** — every run writes trajectories and screenshots to disk for inspection.

If you want a minimal, easy-to-debug starting point for browser-using agents instead of another heavyweight platform, this is it.

<summary><strong>🆚 How Webwright Differs From Other Browser-Agent Repos</strong></summary>

How they differ at the architectural level:

|                     | **Stagehand (Browserbase)**                                  | **agent-browser (Vercel)**                                                | **browser-use**                                       | **Webwright**                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paradigm**        | Hybrid: code + NL primitives (`act` / `extract` / `agent`)   | CLI tool that *another* agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) calls            | Autonomous LLM agent loop over DOM/AX snapshots       | **Coding agent with a terminal**; browser is just an environment it spawns |
| **Action space**    | Playwright code, or NL → LLM-translated Playwright           | Discrete subcommands (`open`, `click @e2`, `snapshot`, `eval`)            | Indexed click/type actions selected by the LLM        | **Free-form Python (writes Playwright scripts itself)**                       |
| **What is "state"?**| The browser session                                          | The browser session (held by daemon across CLI calls)                     | The browser session                                   | **The local workspace — code, screenshots, logs.** Browser is disposable. |
| **Loop shape**      | Imperative; `agent()` does multi-step when needed            | One CLI invocation per micro-step                                         | observe → predict next action → execute → repeat      | write code → execute → inspect screenshots → repair (code-as-action)      |

## 🚀 Browser Quick Start

Webwright lets a coding model launch browsers, inspect pages, and debug its work
from a terminal. Script-based runs produce a reusable Python script. Live-browser
mode keeps a page open across steps and returns an answer without creating a script.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Chromium installed through Playwright
- An API key for your chosen backend (OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter)

### Install

```bash
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium
```

### Script-based run

Export credentials for the configured backend (for example, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
with `model_openai.yaml` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with `model_claude.yaml`). Then:

```bash
python -m cuawright.webwright.run.cli main \
    -c base.yaml -c model_openai.yaml \
    -t "Report the page title and the destination of its main link." \
    --start-url https://example.com \
    --task-id demo_openai \
    -o outputs/default
```

The `image_qa` and `self_reflection` tools use the run's configured model.
When running a tool separately, pass `--model-config` with an absolute path to a
private YAML file containing your `model:` settings. Keep that file outside the
checkout and results directory.

### Live-browser mode

For incremental browsing with native OpenAI `run_command` tool calls, use:

```bash
cuawright-web main -c best_default_judge_json_persistent_cli.yaml -c model_openai.yaml \
  -t "<task>" --start-url "<url>" --task-id example -o outputs/example
```

This config keeps a Browserbase cloud session across commands. Set
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`, and `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` before running.
The agent runs shell commands, inspects the results, and checks its work before
finishing. See the [browser workflow guide](docs/browser.md) for image reading and
trajectory verification.

### 🚩 Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c` | Config file(s) from `src/cuawright/webwright/config/` (stackable). |
| `-t` | Task instruction. |
| `--start-url` | Initial page. |
| `--task-id` | Output subfolder name. |
| `-o` | Output directory. |

---

<a id="desktop-quick-start"></a>

## 🖥️ Desktop Quick Start

`cuawright desktop` runs tasks in an OSWorld-V2 Ubuntu VM. The agent uses a
terminal to inspect applications, run commands, view screenshots, and save its work.
You can give it your own task or run an official benchmark task with a score.

### Requirements and installation

- **Python 3.12+** and a Responses-compatible model API key.
- Docker and access to the gated official task and asset snapshots.

```bash
pip install -e ".[desktop]"
```

Before setup, accept access to the [tasks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/osworld_v2_tasks)
and [assets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xlangai/osworld_v2_assets_gated) on
Hugging Face, then log in:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
hf auth login
cuawright setup osworld --root ~/.cache/cuawright/osworld-v2-2026.08.08
cuawright verify osworld \
  --setup ~/.cache/cuawright/osworld-v2-2026.08.08/setup.json
```

Setup downloads the pinned source, task classes, assets, and VM by default; existing
resources can be registered without copying. Put the API key in a
user-owned file with mode `0600`, outside source, task, asset, and result directories.
Choose a new result directory whose parent already exists.

### Run an arbitrary desktop task

```bash
cuawright desktop run \
  --setup /absolute/path/to/setup.json \
  --credentials /absolute/path/to/api-key \
  --results /absolute/path/to/results/custom \
  --model YOUR_MODEL \
  --instruction "<task>"
```

This workflow has no evaluator or score. For an official scored task:

```bash
cuawright desktop reproduce osworld \
  --setup /absolute/path/to/setup.json \
  --credentials /absolute/path/to/api-key \
  --results /absolute/path/to/results/task-001 \
  --task-id 001 --model YOUR_MODEL --reasoning xhigh
```

For another Responses-compatible provider, pass its full API URL with
`--responses-url`. See [task selection and proxies](REPRODUCE.md#choose-an-official-task)
for official task IDs and `--proxy-config` setup.

Each run saves its settings in `manifest.json`, the agent's actions in `trace.jsonl`,
and the outcome in `result.json`. Images viewed by the agent are embedded in the
trace; desktop runs do not export separate screenshot files. Official benchmark
runs also include the evaluator score. Files created in the VM are not automatically
copied to the host; see [custom tasks](REPRODUCE.md#smoke-and-custom-task).
See [REPRODUCE.md](REPRODUCE.md) for setup, smoke tests, and reproduction commands,
or [desktop setup and execution](docs/desktop.md) for more detail.

## 🔌 Use as a Plugin

CUAWright ships plugin manifests for both [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) ([`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json)) and [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins) ([`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](.codex-plugin/plugin.json)), with the shared skill at [`skills/cuawright-web/`](skills/cuawright-web/) and slash commands at [`skills/cuawright-web/commands/`](skills/cuawright-web/commands/). The host agent drives the Webwright loop natively — no extra LLM API key or cost beyond your host subscription. Hosts that read PNG screenshots natively skip the `image_qa` / `self_reflection` tools.

The bundled `cuawright-web` skill handles browser tasks. Desktop tasks use
`cuawright-desktop`; see [desktop setup](docs/desktop.md).

Common runtime deps (install once after either path):

```bash
pip install -e .
playwright install chromium
```

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

### Install

Install through the bundled marketplace inside Claude Code:

```text
# 1. Add this repo as a Claude Code plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/Webwright

# 2. Install the plugin from that marketplace
/plugin install cuawright@cuawright
```

Prefer a local checkout? Point the marketplace command at the cloned repo instead:

```text
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/Webwright
/plugin install cuawright@cuawright
```

### Use

**Start a new Claude Code session** after installing — plugins are loaded at session start and won't appear until you restart.

You can either ask Claude Code in plain English (the skill auto-activates from its description), or use one of the slash commands:

```
/cuawright:run search Google Flights for flights from SEA to JFK on 2026-08-15 to 2026-08-20
/cuawright:craft search a ticket on Google Flights from LAX to SFO depart June 7 return June 14
```

- `/cuawright:run` (or any plain prompt) produces a **one-shot** `final_script.py` for the literal task values.
- `/cuawright:craft` produces a **reusable CLI tool**: `final_script.py` becomes one parameterized function with a Google-style `Args:` docstring and an `argparse` wrapper whose flags default to the concrete task values, so you can rerun it later with different arguments — e.g. `python final_script.py --origin JFK --destination LAX --depart-date 2026-07-01`.

In both modes Claude Code scaffolds a workspace with `plan.md`, runs instrumented Playwright scripts under `final_runs/run_<id>/`, and visually self-verifies each critical point against the saved screenshots.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenAI Codex</b></summary>

### Install

Codex reads Claude-style marketplaces, so the same repo works as a Codex plugin marketplace. From the Codex CLI:

```bash
# 1. Add this repo as a Codex plugin marketplace
codex plugin marketplace add microsoft/Webwright

# 2. Open the plugin browser and install CUAWright
codex
/plugins
```

Prefer a local checkout?

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/Webwright
```

Then restart Codex so the new marketplace and plugin are picked up.

### Use

In a new Codex thread, either ask in plain English (the skill auto-activates from its description) or invoke the bundled skill explicitly with `@cuawright-web`:

```
@cuawright-web search Google Flights for flights from SEA to JFK on 2026-08-15 to 2026-08-20
```

Codex scaffolds a workspace with `plan.md`, runs instrumented Playwright scripts under `final_runs/run_<id>/`, and visually self-verifies each critical point against the saved screenshots.

To turn the plugin off without uninstalling, set its entry in `~/.codex/config.toml` to `enabled = false` and restart Codex.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hermes Agent</b></summary>

### Install

[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) is a [skills-compatible client](https://agentskills.io), so the same `skills/cuawright-web/` folder loads as a Hermes skill. Symlink it into your Hermes user-skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills
ln -sfn /absolute/path/to/Webwright/skills/cuawright-web ~/.hermes/skills/cuawright-web
```

No Hermes-specific manifest is needed; only `SKILL.md` is loaded.

### Use

Start Hermes (`hermes`) and ask it to drive a web task in natural language — the skill auto-activates from its description. You can also invoke it explicitly with `/cuawright-web`.

Note: the named subcommands shipped under [`skills/cuawright-web/commands/`](skills/cuawright-web/commands/) (`/cuawright:run`, `/cuawright:craft`) are a Claude Code / Codex convention and are inert in Hermes; the skill itself still works end-to-end.

<a id="-task-showcase-repeatable-runs-as-a-dashboard"></a>

<details>
<summary><b>📰 Task Showcase (repeatable runs as a dashboard)</b></summary>

A tiny Flask app under [`assets/task_showcase/`](assets/task_showcase/README.md) consolidates
Webwright runs for **repeatable** odyssey tasks (deals, inventory, listings,
job boards, weather, etc.) into a single dashboard. Each task ships only two
files — `task.json` (metadata) and `report.json` (curated, structured output:
sources + result sections like tables, lists, summaries) — and the templates
render them generically, so adding a new task is just dropping a new folder
in `assets/task_showcase/tasks/`.

```bash
pip install flask
python assets/task_showcase/app.py    # http://127.0.0.1:5005
```

To have Webwright produce a renderer-ready task folder at runtime, stack the
Task Showcase overlay:

```bash
python -m cuawright.webwright.run.cli main \
    -c base.yaml -c model_openai.yaml -c task_showcase.yaml \
    -t "<repeatable web task>" \
    --task-id my_repeatable_task \
    -o outputs/default
```

> **Note:** `report.json` is only generated when `-c task_showcase.yaml` is
> included. A plain `base.yaml` run produces `trajectory.json` and debug
> artifacts but no `report.json`.

The run writes `task_showcase/tasks/<short_id>/task.json` and `report.json`
inside the output workspace. Render those generated files without copying them
back into the repo:

```bash
python assets/task_showcase/app.py \
    --tasks-dir outputs/default/<run>/task_showcase/tasks
```

</details>

<a id="-skill-factory-turn-solved-tasks-into-runnable-code-skills"></a>

<details>
<summary><b>🧠 Skill Factory (turn solved tasks into runnable code skills)</b></summary>

Skill Factory is an optional extension for learning and reusing browser automation
scripts. Install it from this checkout:

```bash
pip install -e ".[skill-factory]" -e extensions/skill-factory
cuawright-skill-factory --help
```

For desktop execution and Skill Factory together, use
`pip install -e ".[desktop,skill-factory]" -e extensions/skill-factory`.

**Most agent skills are context the model reads. Ours are programs.**
[`cuawright.webwright.skill_factory`](extensions/skill-factory/src/cuawright/webwright/skill_factory/) distills the script every solve leaves
behind into a growing library of **reusable, verified, parameterized skills** — code you can run
without a model and compose into the next task instead of re-exploring the site. Plugs in with
**no change to the agent loop**:

- **Reuse** — before a solve starts, the library is checked *out of the agent loop* (`recommend`):
  `route` either runs a matching skill directly (no model) or injects it into the prompt as a prior
  (`{verdict: run|adapt|skip, skill_id, source_path}`); the agent reuses the hint without ever
  querying the library itself.
- **Grow** — afterwards, `python -m cuawright.webwright.skill_factory learn outputs/ --library ./library`
  groups solves of the same template and distills one parameterized skill (`build` does solve→learn
  in one shot; `update` is manual-manifest mode).

Before adding a skill, the input gate compares the result with gold answers when
available. Otherwise it checks the output's shape and the agent's reported success;
this fallback can admit an incorrect answer. The generated script is then replayed
without a model, and updates are checked against previous examples.

Once learned, a skill **runs standalone in ~40 s with zero tokens**. On WebArena (10 retrieve-type
templates, 3 self-hosted sites, gpt-5.4) reuse lifts held-out accuracy **55% → 70% (+15 pp)** while
cutting steps. See [`extensions/skill-factory/src/cuawright/webwright/skill_factory/README.md`](extensions/skill-factory/src/cuawright/webwright/skill_factory/README.md).

<summary><b>📃 Trajectory Comparison &amp; Viewer</b></summary>

You can run the same tasks using the Webwright harness and its Codex / GitHub Copilot skill variant, and see how token usage and trajectories stack up between different harnesses. The trajectory viewer supports Codex, GitHub Copilot and Webwright harness traces.

![Trajectory comparison](assets/trajectory-compare.png)

### How to use

```bash
cd assets/compare_trajectory/
python3 -m http.server
```

Open the webpage in your browser and upload the Webwright `raw_responses.jsonl` and attach `trajectory.json` to view. Then on the other side you can upload your Codex or GitHub Copilot trace.

### Obtaining Codex traces:

```
ls ~/.codex/sessions/2026/MONTH/DAY/SESSION_ID.jsonl
```

### Obtaining GitHub Copilot traces:

```
/export file session
-> session.md is the uploadable trace
```

### Quick Comparison
